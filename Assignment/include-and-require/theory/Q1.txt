// Explain the difference between include and require in PHP.

In PHP,both include and require are used to insert the contents of one PHP file into another.
However,there is a key difference in how they handle errors when the file is missing.

1. include
 
  - If the specified file is not found, PHP throws a warning (E_WARNING) but continues script execution.
  - Used when the missing file is not critical for the script.

2. require

  - If the specified file is not found, PHP throws a fatal error (E_ERROR) and stops execution immediately.
  - Used when the missing file is critical for the script.


Key Differences:

Feature	                               include         	                                require

Error Handling	      Throws a warning (E_WARNING) and continues execution	        Throws a fatal error (E_ERROR) and stops execution
Script Execution	  Continues even if the file is missing	                        Stops immediately if the file is missing
Use Case	          Use for optional files (e.g., sidebar, footer)	            Use for essential files (e.g., database config, authentication)
