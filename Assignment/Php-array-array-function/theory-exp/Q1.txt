// Define arrays in PHP. What are the different types of arrays?


Arrays in PHP :

    An array in PHP is a data structure that stores multiple values in a single variable. Each value in the array is called an element, and each element is associated with a unique key (or index). Arrays in PHP can hold values of any data type, such as integers, strings, objects, or even other arrays.

Types of Arrays in PHP:

    PHP supports three main types of arrays:

1. Indexed Arrays:
    Description: These arrays use numeric indices (starting from 0) to access elements. 

2. Associative Arrays:
    Description: These arrays use named keys (strings) instead of numeric indices. Each key is associated with a value.

3. Multidimensional Arrays:
    Description: These arrays contain other arrays as their elements. They are used to represent complex data structures, such as tables or grids.
