// Explain what PHP expressions are and give examples of arithmetic and logical operations.

What are PHP Expressions:

An expression in PHP is any combination of values, variables, operators, and functions that evaluates to a value.
Expressions are the core building blocks of PHP scripts, as they define operations like calculations, comparisons, and function calls.

1. Arithmetic operations

  - Arithmetic operations in PHP allow mathematical calculations.
 
 Operator:

 Addition (+),subtraction (-),Multiplication (*),Division (/),Modulus(Remainder) (%),Exponentiation (**).

2. Logical operations

  -  Logical operators are used in conditional statements to determine whether an expression evaluates to true or false.

  Operator:
   
   AND (&&), NOT (!), OR (').
