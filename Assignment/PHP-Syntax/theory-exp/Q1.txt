-- Structure of a PHP Script --
A PHP script is structured with the following key components:

    1. PHP Opening and Closing Tags:

       - PHP code is enclosed within <?php (opening tag) and ?> (closing tag).

    2.Declarations and Statements:

       - Inside the PHP tags, you can write PHP statements, which may include variable declarations, loops, conditionals, functions, etc.   

    3.HTML Integration (if necessary):

        - PHP can be used standalone or embedded within an HTML document for generating dynamic content.
    
    4.Comments:

        - PHP allows single-line (// or #) and multi-line comments (/* ... */).
