// Q :- What are the rules for naming variables in PHP?

 --  Rules for Naming Variables in PHP --
    1. Prefix withma dollar sign ($):
       - All variables in PHP must start with a dollar sign ($).

    2.  Followed by a letter or underscore:
       - After the dollar sign, the variable name must begin with either:
            - A letter (a-z or A-Z)
            - An underscore ( _ ).

    3. Can Contain Letters, Numbers, or Underscores:

        - Variable names can only consist of letters (a-z, A-Z), numbers (0-9), and underscores (_).           

    4. No Spaces or Special Characters:

        - Variable names cannot include spaces, hyphens (-), or special characters (e.g., @, #, !, etc.).

    5. Case Sensitivity:

        - Variable names in PHP are case-sensitive. $Name and $name are treated as two different variables.

    6. Cannot Use Reserved Keywords:

        - Variable names cannot use PHP reserved keywords (e.g., class, function, echo, etc.).
