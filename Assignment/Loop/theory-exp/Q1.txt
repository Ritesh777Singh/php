Differences Between for, foreach, and do-while Loops in PHP

1. For Loop

    The for loop is used when the number of iterations is known beforehand. It iterates a block of code a specific number of times, controlled by an initialization, condition, and increment/decrement.

 2. Foreach Loop

    The foreach loop is specifically designed for iterating over arrays or objects. It is used when working with key-value pairs or list-style data.

3. Do-While Loop

    The do-while loop is similar to a while loop but guarantees at least one execution of the code block because the condition is checked after the loop runs.
